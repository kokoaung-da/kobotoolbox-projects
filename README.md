# Kobo Toolbox XLSForm Projects

This project shows my experience in creating survey forms in Kobo Toolbox using XLSForm (Excel format).
I made two Excel files that include cascading questions, which means the next question depends on the answer from the previous one.

These forms can be uploaded directly to Kobo Toolbox or ODK to create smart digital surveys.

📁 Project Files

| File Name	| Description |
|----------- | ----------- |
| engine_oil_survey.xlsx | A Kobo Toolbox form about engine oil products. It uses cascading questions to show only related options. | 
| tire_hot_item_survey.xlsx | 	A Kobo Toolbox form about tire items. It includes dependent dropdowns based on previous selections. |
